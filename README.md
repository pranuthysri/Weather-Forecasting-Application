The Weather App is a real-time project developed using JavaScript, CSS, Express and Handlebars. This project is an interesting project for simply weather forecasting. The user can check the condition of the present-day climate probability and predict whether the day is a cloudy or sunny day. The user can write down the name of any city across the world in the app.
